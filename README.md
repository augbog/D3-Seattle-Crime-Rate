Created by Alex Gingras, Marie Clifford, and Augustus Yuan

A huge thank you to <a href="https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json">johan/world.geo.json</a> for providing us with the GeoJSON files for Washington!

<b>Background</b>
=====================

Washington is divided up into a several counties, but it is also divided up by police beat zones known as precincts. Washington records how many crimes are called in and we are hoping to visualize this data with D3.

You can find a map of the precincts <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/police/maps/precinct_map.htm">here</a>.

You can also find the shape files we used <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Crime/Seattle-Police-Department-Beats/nnxn-434b">here</a>.
